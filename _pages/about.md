My name is Marcos Fernández-Pichel. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2023 from the University of Santiago de Compostela and Universidade da Coruña. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Electronics and Computer Science Department from the University of Santiago de Compostela. I am also a research collaborator from the Centro Singular de Investigación en Tecnoloxías Intelixentes ([CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/es/)). The Royal Galician Academy of Sciences awarded me with the best paper conducted by a young researcher in 2022. My current research interests are Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
